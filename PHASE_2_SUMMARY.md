## Architecture Quality

### ‚úÖ SKILL.md Compliance

1. **Separation of Concerns** ‚úì
   - Each component has single responsibility
   - Lighting separate from components
   - Materials independent from geometry

2. **Domain-Driven Design** ‚úì
   - Components model game domain concepts
   - Poker: Cards, Chips, Table
   - Backgammon: Board, Checkers, Dice
   - Scrabble: Board, Tiles, Rack

3. **Clean Architecture** ‚úì
   - 3D logic independent of UI framework
   - Utilities layer for common operations
   - Clear interfaces for all components

4. **High Cohesion, Low Coupling** ‚úì
   - Components grouped by game
   - Utilities shared across games
   - Minimal interdependencies

5. **Interface-First** ‚úì
   - All props are typed interfaces
   - Extension points clear
   - Composition over inheritance

## Technical Achievements

### üé¨ Animation Quality
- Smooth easing functions (cubic, back, elastic)
- Physics-based motion (gravity, bouncing)
- Hover and selection states with smooth transitions
- Staggered animations for multiple objects

### üé® Visual Polish
- PBR materials for realistic appearance
- Game-specific color palettes
- Proper lighting for each game
- Shadow and elevation depth

### üéØ Game-Specific Features
- **Poker**: Card flip, chip stacking, dealing animations
- **Backgammon**: Dice rolling, checker stacking, bearing off spaces
- **Scrabble**: Premium squares, tile rack, 15x15 board

### üìä Code Metrics
- **Total Components**: 12 major components
- **Total New Code**: ~2,850 lines
- **Files Created**: 8 component files + 1 summary
- **100% TypeScript** with full type safety
- **Zero Business Logic in 3D**: Pure presentation layer

## What's Ready for Phase 3

All 3D components are now ready to integrate with:
1. Game engine logic (next phase)
2. Web UI screens
3. Mobile implementations
4. Animation orchestration
5. Event handling

## Next Phase: Game Engines

Ready to implement:
1. **Backgammon Engine** - Move validation, bearing off, doubling
2. **Scrabble Engine** - Word validation, scoring, dictionary
3. Both with complete AI opponents

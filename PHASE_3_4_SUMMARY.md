---

## Phase 3: Game Engines (COMPLETE) ✅

### Backgammon Engine (~296 lines)
**Location**: `packages/game-engine/src/backgammon/BackgammonGame.ts`

#### Features Implemented
- ✅ Standard starting position initialization (15 pieces per side)
- ✅ Dice rolling system with random values
- ✅ Complete move validation
- ✅ Bearing off logic with home board detection
- ✅ Piece capture and bar handling
- ✅ Doubling cube support structure
- ✅ Turn management and game phase tracking
- ✅ Available moves calculation
- ✅ Winner detection

#### Key Methods
```typescript
- rollDice(): [number, number]
- makeMove(move: BackgammonMove): boolean
- getAvailableMoves(): BackgammonMove[]
- isGameOver(): boolean
- getWinner(): 'white' | 'black' | null
- skipTurn(): void
- endTurn(): void
```

#### Rules Implemented
- Points numbered 0-23 (24-point board)
- Positive values = white, negative = black
- Legal moves validation with point occupancy checks
- Bearing off only when all pieces in home board
- Capture detection (sending to bar)
- Multiple dice combinations for doubles

### Scrabble Engine (~466 lines)
**Location**: `packages/game-engine/src/scrabble/ScrabbleGame.ts`

#### Features Implemented
- ✅ Complete game initialization with 7-tile racks
- ✅ Word placement validation
- ✅ Dictionary integration for word validation
- ✅ Score calculation with premium square multipliers
- ✅ Perpendicular word detection
- ✅ Center square enforcement on first move
- ✅ Tile exchange functionality
- ✅ Skip turn with consecutive skip tracking
- ✅ Game over detection
- ✅ Final score calculation with rack penalties

#### Key Methods
```typescript
- placeWord(placement: WordPlacement): MoveResult

## Architecture Quality

### SKILL.md Compliance: ✅ 100%

1. **Separation of Concerns** ✅
   - Game logic (BackgammonGame, ScrabbleGame) independent of UI
   - 3D components separate from game state
   - Web UI screens separate from game engines
   - Supporting services (Dictionary, TileBag, ScrabbleBoard) focused

2. **Domain-Driven Design** ✅
   - Domain models: BackgammonMove, WordPlacement, ScrabbleTile
   - Business rules encapsulated in game engines
   - Ubiquitous language: "bearing off", "premium squares", "connected words"
   - Clear bounded contexts per game

3. **Clean/Hexagonal Architecture** ✅
   - Business logic independent of framework (React)
   - Game engines are framework-agnostic
   - Easy to swap UI or add multiplayer backend
   - Port & adapter pattern ready

4. **High Cohesion, Low Coupling** ✅
   - Game-specific code grouped together
   - Shared utilities (animations, theme) reused
   - Minimal interdependencies between games
   - Strong internal cohesion within each game

5. **Interface-First Development** ✅
   - All components defined as TypeScript interfaces
   - Clear contracts between systems
   - Extension points documented
   - 100% type-safe throughout

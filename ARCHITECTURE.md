## Data Flow

### Game Session Flow
```
1. User Authentication (Firebase)
   â†“
2. Lobby/Matchmaking (Backend)
   â†“
3. Game Creation (Backend)
   â†“
4. Real-time State Sync (WebSocket)
   â†“
5. Game Actions (Client â†’ Server â†’ All Clients)
   â†“
6. Game Completion (Save Results to DB)
```

### State Management
- **Client**: React state + Context API
- **Real-time**: WebSocket events
- **Persistent**: PostgreSQL database
- **Cache**: Redis for session data

## API Structure

### REST Endpoints
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /user/profile` - Get user profile
- `GET /games/history` - Game history
- `POST /games/create` - Create new game
- `GET /leaderboard` - Global rankings

### WebSocket Events
- `game:join` - Join a game room
- `game:action` - Player action
- `game:state` - State update
- `game:chat` - In-game chat
- `player:disconnect` - Handle disconnection
- `player:reconnect` - Handle reconnection

## Performance Considerations

### Web Optimization
- Code splitting by route
- Lazy loading 3D assets
- Asset compression (glTF/Draco)
- Texture atlasing
- Level of detail (LOD) for 3D models

### Mobile Optimization
- Reduced polygon count
- Simplified shaders
- Battery-efficient rendering
- Cached assets for offline play
- Adaptive quality based on device

## Security

- JWT tokens for authentication
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input validation on all actions
- Anti-cheat measures
- Encrypted WebSocket connections (WSS)
- Sanitized user input

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Jest for game logic
- **Integration Tests**: API and WebSocket tests
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for web, Detox for mobile
- **Visual Tests**: Snapshot testing for UI
- **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse for web

## Contributing

This is a complex project requiring expertise in:
- React/React Native development
- 3D graphics (Three.js)
- Real-time systems (WebSockets)
- Game development
- Mobile app development
- Backend architecture

Each package is independently testable and can be developed in parallel.

# Getting Started

## What We've Built So Far

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)

We've created a professional monorepo architecture with:

1. **Monorepo Structure** using Turborepo
   - Optimized build pipeline
   - Shared workspaces
   - Parallel execution

2. **Four Shared Packages**:
   - `@classic-games/shared-ui` - UI components and theme
   - `@classic-games/game-engine` - Complete Poker game logic!
   - `@classic-games/three-components` - 3D component interfaces
   - `@classic-games/utils` - Shared utilities

3. **Complete Poker Implementation**
   - Full Texas Hold'em rules
   - Hand evaluation (all ranks)
   - Betting system with all-in support
   - AI player logic
   - State management

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Building (Recommended for MVP)
Continue implementing the apps in this order:

1. **Web App** - Fastest to see results
   - Set up Next.js with React Three Fiber
   - Create 3D poker table
   - Connect to game engine
   - Add basic UI

2. **Backend** - Enable multiplayer
   - Node.js + Express + Socket.io
   - Authentication
   - Game rooms
   - Real-time sync

3. **Mobile App** - Native experience
   - Expo with Three.js
   - Touch controls
   - Haptic feedback

### Option 2: Focus on One Game
Polish one game completely before moving to others:
- Complete all 3D assets for Poker
- Add sound effects and animations
- Implement AI with difficulty levels
- Create tutorial mode

### Option 3: Build All Game Engines
Complete the game logic for all three games:
- Finish Backgammon game engine
- Finish Scrabble game engine
- Add comprehensive tests

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/allansmeyatsky/classic-games-monorepo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Start development (once apps are set up)
npm run dev

# Run specific app
npm run mobile    # Mobile app
npm run web       # Web app
npm run backend   # Backend server
```

## What You Need to Do

Before continuing, you need to:

1. **Install dependencies** in the monorepo:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/allansmeyatsky/classic-games-monorepo
   npm install
   ```

2. **Choose your path**:
   - Do you want to see a working game quickly? → Build Web App
   - Do you want to focus on mobile? → Build Mobile App
   - Do you want multiplayer working? → Build Backend
   - Do you want all games done? → Complete game engines

3. **Prepare assets** (for 3D):
   - 3D models for cards, chips, tables
   - Textures (wood, felt, metal)
   - Sound effects
   - Music

## Poker Game Engine Highlights

The poker engine is production-ready with:
- `Card` class with suit/rank/value
- `Deck` class with shuffle and deal
- `HandEvaluator` with all hand ranks
- `PokerPlayer` with betting logic
- `PokerGame` with full game flow
- Side pot calculation
- All-in support
- Proper state management

## Technology Decisions Made

- ✅ Turborepo for monorepo
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ React 19 for UI
- ✅ Three.js for 3D graphics
- ✅ React Three Fiber for web
- ✅ Expo for mobile
- ✅ Socket.io for real-time multiplayer
- ✅ Firebase for authentication

## What's Your Next Move?

Tell me what you'd like to focus on:

1. "Set up the web app with Next.js and React Three Fiber"
2. "Set up the mobile app with Expo"
3. "Build the backend with WebSocket multiplayer"
4. "Complete Backgammon and Scrabble game engines"
5. "Create the 3D poker table and cards"
6. Something else?

The foundation is solid and ready to build on! 🚀
